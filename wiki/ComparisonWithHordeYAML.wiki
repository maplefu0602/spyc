== Comparing Spyc to Horde_YAML ==

[http://pear.horde.org/index.php?package=yaml Horde_YAML] is a YAML parser based on an older version of Spyc. 

== Parsing accuracy ==

Horde_YAML, as a package based on a deprecated Spyc version, has severe parsing flaws fixed in the recent versions of Spyc. For example, Horde_YAML 1.0.1 will fail to parse the following examples of valid YAML:

1.
{{{
array on several lines:
  [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,
    10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 ]
}}}

2.
{{{
switches:
  - { row: 0, col: 0, func: {tx: [0, 1]} }
}}}

== Performance ==

Horde_YAML 1.0.1 parser performs a tiny bit faster than Spyc 0.4.1:

{{{
Horde_YAML: completed 1000 iterations in 13.2576999664 s.
Spyc: completed 1000 iterations in 13.3907561302 s.
